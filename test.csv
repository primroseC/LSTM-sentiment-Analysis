Pretty good I learned a lot,2
Very hard to understand assignments,1
really enjoyed the writing assignments as a creative project but I do not feel I was able to fully grasp the concepts despite getting good marks,1
Content of the lesson marred by extremely poor presentation,1
This is particularly egregious in regards to the assignments,1
as a lack of fluency from the content writers makes the experience of knowing what precisely is being asked an unnecessarily frustrating process,1
the peer review system needs work and the quizzes that pop up during videos are annoying and useless,1
"The feedback we receive from peers is usually limited to a couple of words and does not really help you assess how well you did	",1
too much work,1
too much specific question,1
a lot of not related knowledge that we need to learn,1
Not useful in my opinion,1
the course is missing a contingency plan in case somebody fails a session,1
Since assessments are peer reviewed I do not see the motivation of my peers to come back and grade me again,1
which means I cannot complete the course on time despite being on time with all assignments,1
"I got a bit impatient with that towards the end	1",1
I can see that the lecturer's intention was giving an overview by mentioning all different topics it just got me confused,1
I see in the discussion forums that github is a problem for most of the students in the forums,1
I wish it was more into a solo topic It would be great if it was given only git/github lectures so the students can be more comfortable when it comes to uploading fles in the following courses,1
Really easy course,1
Loved the course but my first quiz shows me wrong though I write correct answers,1
Will be nice if someone can rectify it,1
Very basic stuff - if you've ever done any coding before and have even a rudimentary knowledge of Github - you can skip this course,1
Terribly run waste of money Better off going to Data Camp,1
Very superficial knowledge More pratical exercises are needed and daily problem examples The use of github and his pratical purpose is not clear,1
Very basic,1
Nothing much important,1
Maybe a good basic intro course but quite simple,1
"Seemed pretty useless to me	",1
It's great to learn how to use GitHub but this hardly qualifies as a course,1
Not very useful,1
Not a lot of good information Just introducing you to the programs being used,1
give you good basic for data science and tools required,1
I have a problem with the soundThat quality is so bad I think,1
Very easy I am unsure if this is a good thing or not,1
some information was interesting but in general I do not think it was crucial for learning R,1
VERY basic course some of the week's assignments were simply installing software for future use,1
I believe that in some of the assingments the student is asked to do a few things that werent taught in the course,1
And also during one of the quizzes the platform wasn't working propperly and I had to answere it many times,1
I do not really think that this amount of information should exist as a whole separate course,1
OK course A brief overview but the sequence of material is not that well thought out in my opinion,1
This was inconvenient for them because I had to put in several support requests as I progressed through the course even though I installed as much as I was allowed to,1
It was too short and too easy,1
I cannot believe there is a style of teaching where you never get to see the best way to do something,1
Really enjoyed the Course and the lecture really made it very interesting,2
Great course and amazing spirit and commitment from the faculty team,2
great course very enthusiastic lecturer,2
"Very interesting professor but uses too much of the time for tangents	",2
"as this helped me practically pin down concepts which I found difficult to grasp in the past	2",2
"I particularly liked the constant connection with philosophical schools of thought	2",2
Very informative course very engaging videos and assignments,2
might come along as time consuming but that they really help you to grasp each concept/ tehcnique discussed,2
Excellente course for a basic insight,2
Very detailed Very engaging Extremely well researched! More on Analysis and Writing would be appreciated,2
Awesome course The lecturer did a great job,2
Very good course and very worthwhile your time,2
The lecturer is very enthusiastic and will also make you enthusiastic about qualitative research,2
To really understand qualitative research you need to do more reading on your own but this course gives a good overview,2
I have never seen a more passionate teacher than this,2
So refreshing and engaging,2
He was definitely born to do this and influence others,2
A good overview of qualitative research methods from a sociological and anthropological perspective,2
Love the enthusiastic instructor,2
Definitely made me realize that there is so much to learn and experience in the world of rigorous qualitative research that one cannot simply pick up when working in research-related roles in the industry,2
Great course,2
Very important to understand basic concepts on qualitative research,2
very well designed excellent course,2
This is great course,2
Strong effort on the production team,2
But I do not think mooc is a suitable format for this course,2
"You can only learn qualitative research by doing it	",2
Excellent in everthing,2
Fun and very interesting,2
difficult material was made easy,2
The professor is engaging and the lectures very well orgaqnised,2
I very much liked the content of the course,2
the pace was nicely pitched,2
and the videos really well done,2
And I also found the practice exam really useful where the course convener explained the answers in separate videos,2
I also liked that I could print the script for each modulethat made it a lot easier to revise,2
And I also found the practice exam really useful where the course convener explained the answers in separate videos,2
Incredible course,2
Very interesting course! Explanations were clear,2
I stayed motivated all the course period The choice of the quizzes were also very successful,2
The course is well structured,2
It helped me a lot to organize the concepts that I already had about research methodsI stayed motivated all the course period,2
I learned a lot,2
The course have excellent resources and explanations,2
I found the course very interesting  even very complex in some topics but that was really constructive too ,2
the additional interviews after each week extended the material from the virtual classroom to the real world of scientific research,2
This course is a solid introduction to Quantitative Methods I plan to continue and finish the entire Specialization,2
Useful information presented in a step-by-step easy to follow way I stayed motivated throughout the course and was pleased with the content,2
"The content could have been more concise and more structured	3",0
Some assessments were also not clearas one interpretation of the assessment would not always lead to scoring maximum points,0
More on Analysis and Writing would be appreciated,0
One thing only would make it perfect Instead of having the slides as notes  the same info could be organised differently in a word document as it would be easier to read and to print out,0
I think it would be really helpful if similar videos could exist for each of the written assignments,0
Having someone who teaches the course provide sample answers or discussion videos for each written assignment would add a lot of value and aid students' learning,0
a bit more detail in the examples would help rather than brief general descriptions,0
My only quibble is that its geared toward the experimental sciences and so the exams and assignments emphasized concepts and research design issues that are less germane to other fields,0
I got a bit impatient with that towards the end,1
"I noted that some of the questions in the tests in particular were somewhat strangely worded which sometimes made me question what exactly you were trying to get at	",0
I would suggest simpler and more precise wording to avoid that All round  great course though,0
Less Content  should be more technical Mostly repetitive from the the crash course in data science Should have put an optional videos for git,0
Could be more interactive,0
Git should be introduced more slowly over multiple course,0
I cannot possibly absorb all the command line instructions that were mentioned in the class There are just too many,1
Please spread out the course content on Git over 3 or 4 courses,0
so we can practice it as we submit assignments I forsee numerous wasted hours fiddling with Git Bash trying to make it work  not knowing what mistake I am making,0
More direct examples would be nice Kinda like what they do on Data School Otherwise very well done,0
This is a good introduction the tools  however I had some issues with Git Bash and Git Hub  which was nor really answered in the lectures  could update the lectures with a live example,0
however I would expect more precision from Johns Hopkins Additionally the narrator (at times) seemed as if he was getting exhausted/running out of fuel towards the end of each lesson,0
Some of the instruction is not exactly clear Perhaps you all are attempting to make the student engage in some heuristic thinking,0
I noticed that w/in the course video's there were numerous cases of misspelled words and even some incorrect information When it comes to a class like this  precise and clear instructions are a necessity,0
I would like to see more practical exercises about R,0
