Pretty good I learned a lot,2,,,2for positive,,,,,41,220,,49,46,22
I put three stars because it should be specified more how basic this course is,1,,,1for negative,,,,,218,,,220,218,41
is almost that this is done for somebody that does not know almost anything from CS,1,,,0for suggestions,,,,,,,,269,264,63
Too much material Too soon I am new to R and the stuff was a bit overwhelming,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,100
The course got easier as I advanced through the other courses,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is more of an overview of what is to come,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A lot of what is presented here could just be in the format of a word or PDF with a series of links,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for people that might have some experience with R statistics and ML in general this is way to basic,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I suppose it is ok as a foundation it does not offer much on its own,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Somewhat interesting to get an idea of what can be done with Github but I do not feel prepared to actually use it,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am aware that this is the introduction to this topic but it was a bit long drawn out,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the content of the course could be a week of some course of specialization,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall it was ok though not yet extremely intense or informative	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Few content for an entire course I think this one could be together with R Programming,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the peer graded setting of projects really delays the grant of certificate,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It took me more than two sessions of waiting just to get a grade for the peer review project,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this course is not well organized at all Instructors basically just read words in slides,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no interesting examples and no hands on practices,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially week 4 slides that look like a syntax reference document,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all  Instructors basically just read words in slides,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no interesting examples and no hands-on practices,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially week 4 slides that look like a syntax reference document,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the entire instruction is very boring,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making me wonder why I need to sit here and listen to word reading rather than buying a textbook,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This entire specialization is the one that I have taken and feel the worst,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately this specialization instruction is just about reading words in the boring slides,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not that useful,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too simple and most contents are overlapped already covered in other sessions	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very average do not feel I learnt much Still not sure if it is over or not since I have submitted a peer review assignment and cannot go any further,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A good attempt to give introduction on basic Data Science tools though most videos end abruptly which spoils the seamless navigation experience Maybe the team can work on this,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course was just fine but I do not think we should spent entire 4 weeks on it One or two week for this course would be better I think,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was a little put off by having to grade my peers and it felt like the final task required a few bits of information that hadn't been previously covered,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a bad first course but not what I expected,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too few activities for the time allocated,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little bit too slow and too easy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a very bad experience with this whole course set-up,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Especially the peer grading you have no insight on why they assigned this score to you nothing,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially when you know you did your course work correctly i will never come back to coursera waste of money,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course stays on the surface and does not delve too deep,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably in order to not scare off people who are new to the subject,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can slog thru the programming but I doubt it is the best way to do something,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but I never get to see how something should have been done,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not bad but certainly not good,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not very helpful Unnecessarily lengthy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do not know any thing about data sciencegood introduction,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
a wast of time,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very insubstantial in terms of material  Much more can be done in 4 weeks	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is very basic and takes nowhere near 1 month I spent about 3 hours in total on it,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the project became very confusing since no examples were done in the lectures,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worthless course There should have been no need for this course and the fact that they charge money for this is disappointing,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This module could have been easily merged with the next module  Just a few pages with instructions on how to install the required softwares and repositories would have sufficed,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little boring Necessary if you have ABSOLUTELY no experience with data analysis,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not really useful,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you are not already experienced in data science it also requires a fair amount of imagination to picture what all these tools are actually used for,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad course so far Very little detail and Assignments are very hard to solve Worst $500 dollars spent in my life and the course is not worth even $10,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am an online instructor myself and the quality of the course is not worth its price	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poorly organized Poorly communicated No reliable source of assistance with technical problems,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This module should not be kept as a separate piece	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too little materials can finish in two nights,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annoying,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The entire 4 weeks could have (and should have) been condensed into 1 week,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very basic course I was able to complete the 4 weeks on content in a weekend,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would recommend skipping this module and moving directly to the R Programming course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too basic not very informative Waste of money,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very basic overview of the tools and installation of them Should be an optional course rather than part of the specialization,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have no idea why you called it course since there was nothing inside,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could not hear the videos,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not worth 29$ considering you could take away very little from this course	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too simple too easy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is too easy as a ""university"" course It is much more like a pratictioner course The final exam is ridiculous really too easy",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However could cover the usage of the terminal and Rstudio better,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very bad,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this course is very poorly structured,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you have much programming background this course will be a breeze,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it is sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bit too simple to be a paid course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software This course takes only 20 minutes to complete It is also obsessed with command line interfaces,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this a real course for a data scientist just installing shit and a peer reviewing for that screenshot and forking all repos very bad not worth to be with rest course in specialization,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There just was not much to this class It is not bad information but it could have been done in one week,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a GitHub account,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very shallow overview not really a full course I would say,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did not learn anything in this one,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you go to the program's websites there is directions to install it anyway,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so this was completely unnecessary,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is an extremely basic introduction which does not help in much for the next session,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was hoping to learn more stuff I did not already know,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This class is more of just a vague overview of the other courses,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Way too basic for the price - almost no content - this is just setup  I resent paying for setup instructions	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not much content for this course can be done in a few hours,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible! Go to Data Camp and save a bunch of money,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But here we are given just names of topics and told to research & read about them ourselves,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not as clear and straightforward as R Programming But definitely a worthwhile course to look at,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am taking way longer due to errors in loading packages and Java,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much talking Not enough integrated exercises,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course material needs update There are code snippets that do not work,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very scattered and unfocused course Sad to say that I learned very little from this one,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor teaching! Almost a waste of time,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mediocre presentation of tidy data which is probably the most critical topic,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its mostly just walking through what commands to use in R to load in various file formats,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the practical things had to be learned by self learning instead of in the course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peer graded assignment took for ever to pass,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Final assignment is not well detailed and may cause confusion,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The assignment was tough,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course is not that hard but there is a lot of content to assimilate,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taught without purpose; meaningless instructions given to copy without regard of the bigger picture,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lectures are too fastdropping out,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Course is too simple should be more extensive,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rest was too confusing with lots of lists and no explanations,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too difficult practical exercises with the theorical background given,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poorly constracted course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a lot of fluff in this course and at the same time it assumes that you have knowledge and skills that are not covered in this course or in the previous two	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am really disappointed in the quality of this course--specifically at how vague many of the instructions were in the quiz questions and the final project,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The videos did not teach anything that was going to be on the quiz,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
less hands-on exercises and this course covers too much topics without details,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The worst! I do not recommend you to take any course from this institute It is just wasting time and money	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The evaluation part of the course needs some fixing,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example does not really teach you anything,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I struggled with the lecturer's style spoke too fast,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are quite a few issues with the final assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel this assignments lacks quality in contents suffers from a flawed process and lack of attention by the moderator,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes is hard to follow,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course lacks projects to implement the skills we learn,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is just because of the unclarity of the final assignment,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lecture material was high level,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The description for the final project was not very detailed  and did not seem to be a good preparation for the quizzes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good material,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course was interesting,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same information repeated almost all the time,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like the video were made independantly of the course and simply uploaded into Coursera,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Course material is not enough to understand course as whole Instructor just reading slides and not enough examples demonstrated,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not much to take in this course comparing to the previous courses Worst of all video lectures are not well organised,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not think it requires a separate course for this topic possibly combine it with other courses and introduce neural networks,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should not be a different course It shold be very very concise,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in fact a lot of the videos repeated the same information,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too expensive for such a simple course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Completely irrelevant material,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the course is not at all balanced laid out well there is a peer assignment in week which you need to have covered week 2's content for	1",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an awful course  there is very little purpose to it whatsoever it is basically a module in markdown which will in all honesty not have much application for most learners,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he recording quality of some of the lectures is awful,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for Courser,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this entire specialisation is of awful quality,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not a data science course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a here's a few useful things in R course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the instructors should be ashamed that their institution makes money from it,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seems like the course lectures are out of order or duplicated,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses One separate course for this topic is a waste of money,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had an unpleasant experience with assignments (so it is not a problem to receive knowledge  but problem to receive a certificate,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first problem is time Assignments are extreme time consuming They basically consist of scientific articles peer reviews,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did not need to read lecture material more than 1 time but I spent about 10 hours to complete 1 assignment (and you need to do 6 of them,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next problem with assignments So now I also need to worry about receiving bad grades from students  who will find 2 similar works,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a very hard and time-consuming work and I was terrified to find my work copy pasted by other student,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found my work (my assignment) to be stolen for 2 times This is a nightmare for a person  who worked so hard,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not like me judging too strictly - students just can not fulfil all the requirements Like they write only 2 points instead of 10 Maybe this is the cause why they still my work,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And this article review is a very hard task if you don`t have any experience  so I found other students like 70% failing this task,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not like me judging too strictly - students just can not fulfil all the requirements Like they write only 2 points instead of 10 Maybe this is the cause why they still my work,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course is not very popular so I am already waiting about month to be able to review 5 assignments from other students,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About peer reviewing – this is not my first course on Coursera and I know that 5 peer reviews to complete the assignment is a lot usually 3 is enough,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the last assignment is simply horror	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don`t pass it - you can retake it only after a month when you have forgotten the half of material,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And bonus - you will not see your mistakes as you usually do on Coursera so no cheating and coping your answers is possible,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Course was extremely helpful and informative Condition of reviewing five assignments instead of three created a lot of problems due to non-availability of required submissions ,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought it was a shame that my elective assignment in week 6 was not marked - perhaps if you're offering extra assignments,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I believe it will be useful for anyone looking to get a good understanding and grounding in quantitative methods	2",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found the course easy to follow through  and learned a lot about the historical background to philosophy and science as well as research methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely well presented relevant and concise The interviews were really interesting and really expand and clarrfy some issues related to the vdeo lectures,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good course for people who are new to this branch of study,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a robustly designed course with challenging assignments Your progress through this course will be rewarding,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent course beginner level but enlightening on so many levels Thank you for everything,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was an exceptional experience with University of Amsterdamsince this course is very well organized and the quality of teaching as well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will attend the other 4 courses,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend it because in did increase my knowledge in social science methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a well and clearly structured course Although rich in content it was enjoyable and useful to complete,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a very helpful course for beginners,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assignments tend to be quite lengthy but its necessary to fortify understanding towards the subject matter Thank you for organizing the course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the lectures and how they are being carried out Easily digestible and understandable by prospective students,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing course and so detailed  first module is little bit boring but later on its so interactive and useful,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course I learnt alot here Thanks to the instructor,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This course was on a topic I have never been exposed to and will be necessary for ongoing research work	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quizzes  assignments and tests were at the right level and built to a crescendo Really can't say enough good things but will say that it was everything I needed and delivered with the highest professionalism than I had expected,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The difficulty of the material for me was in the language and the newness of the content that was made quite easy to follow ,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very informative   liked the drawings idea it makes abstract concepts easier to digest,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is exactly what I hoped it to be,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Synthetic but always clear  challenging and high-level,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel that I gained a good introductive knowledge of quantitative methods and I can't wait to follow the next courses,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This course is quite interesting I have learned a lot and has exposed me to many things I do not know about research	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course was a nice introduction to quantitative methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found it achieved this purpose The lecturer was great: very engaging and clear,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Among all the MOOCs around the internet this course is one of my favorite,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course for anyone interested in thinking like a professional scientist,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All concepts have been presented very clearly with adequate examples,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course was excellent in all aspects including the interesting and extensive material as well as Dr Annemarie Zand Scholten's brilliant lectures that help students digest and enjoy the content,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first 3 weeks were a little difficult to follow but then i catch up with the terms and definitions week 4 became very enjoyable wish i could took the quiz without payment,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You must listen to the interviews  Interviews are the best part that sum up all ideas on the related week,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quite a nice refresher  Must do for all the researchers,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course was just amazing,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you so much for the structured fundamental information and the additional interviews which were very valuable,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the way it is structured and especially the way the matherial learned was reflected in the tasks for each week It is nothing like the formal education I have got in my country and I am really grateful for an opportunity to learn form greatest minds while sitting at home,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Concise and thorough course on the current methodology of quantitative research  grounded on a historical development,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good video's  relevant quizes and peer review essays,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A really great course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also really like it how this University does not assume you know everything  and starts from the start,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved the pictures used as examples and the bonus interviews really helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was excellent Useful and understandable,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good groundwork,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I certainly recommend it to anyone interested in research methods  statistics or better preparing for graduate-level work and research in general,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I strongly believe the dedicated work by Dr Annemarie Zand Scholten the course creator and professor along with the whole team did a superb job,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was extremely impressed and pleased both by the professor,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The course was thorough  and introduced the concepts clearly and concisely,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a clearly structured and clearly presented course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lecturer  the explanations and the examples used also well supported the course content,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would highly recommend this course to those new to the subject,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I liked the course very much,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is course was put together very well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am glad i took this course and highly recommend it to anyone seeking to improve their knowledge of Quantitative Methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is delivered in a manner that is easy to understand despite the technical nature of many of the concepts,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The professor presented in a way that was easy to understand; the course was very well structured,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also liked the bonus videos very useful!! Sincere thanks to the professor and the team,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was an exciting experience to be the part of this It enhanced my way of understanding the concepts  with excellent examples and practical learning,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a quite fun and interesting course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For people that are new to Data Science this is a good introduction,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From what I have seen in the second course  the material becomes a lot more difficult  which I was glad to see,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very useful course if you are interested in how properly conduct a research,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent course that disseminated information in easily understandable  digestable manner,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you very much for keeping me busy on all those wonderful evenings,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not an easy course by any means  but if you take notes as you watch the videos and do the practice tests  you will do fine,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a great introduction to Quantitative research methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to learn about research and statistics  this course is a great starting point,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After taking this course  I decided to take the rest of the courses to complete the Research Specialization,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extra ordinary course deliverycontentand research training,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one of the best courses I have taken on Coursera or even in traditional university,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a great introduction to Quantitative research methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the end of it  I really felt that I had gained a lot of valuable knowledge,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The explanations are simple and easy to follow  and cover the topics in quite a lot of depth,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The assignments are demanding and challenging  but doable  and it is nice that analytic and creative essays are combined so as to not put too much strain on students,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
creative assignments are more fun and light weight  while the analytical assignments provide an opportunity to revise the materials more carefully and delve into the core of the topics,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course  taught by very passionate lecturers who know their stuff,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very clearly structured and presented course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
useful and comprehensive Highly recommended,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am very happy with both content and pedagogical aspects of the Quantitative Methods course	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course  very thorough and an interesting peer review system that allows fairly complex ideas and assignments to be managed,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excelente curso El contenido es muy bueno,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent course! Loved it! Very clear and organised I learned a lot,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I work in Scientific Research field  were I use this knowledge every day and I know all the given information  just need a course certificate,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is truly well organized  it is full of information and has everything you should know about the topic,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved funny examples  which are used continuously through the course and help to understand material very well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I am not really happy with the course assignments and not sure if I will be able to receive the certificate  but I would recommend it to person,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is wonderful course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The videos were very well done I also really liked the exercises they were challenging and very relevant I highly recommend,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really learned solid knowledge to this specific approach in doing social scientific research,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a great course overall It had quite a lot of content  which is rare of an online course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the contents were explained in enough detail,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The assignments demanded more time than many other online courses but were feasible based on the course content,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have completed 8 courses on Coursera so far and this was by far one of the best! Thank you for creating this course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My deepest Gratitudes to Assistant Professor,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for her amazing work ( well-prepared lectures with lot's of assignments to solve in addition extra reading links ,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and bonus videos are very helpful and very beneficial,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the course is a great experience if anyone is interested in obtaining and gaining useful information and knowledge about Social Sciences further  Quantitative Methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am so excited to finish the entire track one course done 4 to go,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As an ecologist  it was a great first experience on social sciences Explanations,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A highly recommended course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very good course  just needs more extra info like books and papers to have a more in depth look into quantitative methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a great course for a someone who is a beginner,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They were not too difficult providing the correct balance for students to get to know the topic better and also not be over burdened by the course structure	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really liked the approach of analyzing other researches,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find it very well structured and very well explained,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a nice course and provide me good understanding of Quantitative Research methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very good really helps me out,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is not well managed with lots of waste of time waiting for other peopel to rate your assignment,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicely designed course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peer review system is good I learned good amount of knowledge about research methodology which I could not fully get in the university,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By the help of ""Quantitative Methods"" now I have some ideas how to star my PhD research in the upcoming year",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am in my second year of teaching high school students about research and this course is essential in establishing a foundational knowledge of how good research is done,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really enjoyed the course I found the format easy to follow and the exercises very practical and problem oriented,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great introduction to the bases of philosophy of science  principles of quantification  scientific experiments and critical analysis for identifying good (or sloppy) science,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I learned a great deal from this course - the professor is clear well organized,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would have appreciated an additional session early on about how to review a research article,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to help students feel more prepared to actually perform the assignments,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I am glad that I did continue  and hope that others will too  as it is a well-taught  valuable course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very good introduction	2",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is a fabulous course	2",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most important of all  I have benefited greatly from professor Scholten's clear and logic style of lecturing and well-designed assignments,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which has developed my evaluative skills in applying the new knowledge to assess the methodological quality of real research work,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It helps me to understand basic concepts in quantitative research methods and the way how scientific discoveries should work and actually works,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I learned a lot it might be worth having mentors checking and grading them Apart from that  the video lectures are informative and enjoyable  as are the interviews,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very interesting and informative course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lectures are pretty good from a theoretical point of view as it breaks down the finer details in understanding the concepts pretty well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A very interesting course and there is a nice mix of assignments with practical and theoretical applications,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am very content with the way the course information is presented,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The video's were very clear and concise,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you very much for making this course	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The format was perfect and pretty straightforward,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course actually was a revolutionary one for me,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent course for the social science researchers,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annemarie Zand Scholten is just perfectly explaining the basic ideas of the quantitative methods,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt some more examples could be useful in getting people adjusted to GIT,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A little bit vague  could use more practice using git and git hub,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I would have preferred to have these tutorials integrated with the more substantial courses in the specialization That way I could see how these tools fit in to an actual project	",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The steps mentioned in the lectures does not properly cover what is asked in the assignments The lecture content needs to improve to cover the assignment,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interesting  but could be improved with further applications,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish we had more things do submit so we will learn more,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expected more explanation with the teaching part  detailed lecture depicting live examples is needed to explain each and every module of the course,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar examples like Assignments can be taught by hard-coding them with Rstudio,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel more hands-on exercises and quizzes should have been there,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Small practice quizzes for testing incremental learning within a week should be there,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would have preferred if there were programming assignments that incorporated reading from data sources on the web,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe that this module could be split up to other modules on the Data Science Specialization,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend reviewing the three assignments It will be more productive by removing the confusion  frustration and time wastage,0,,,,,,,,41,,,,,
It was a good course  although it could have been better with more practical approach,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only thing is I wish the Professor had used slightly more practical or real world experiments to explain the concepts instead of examples like rating mother-in-laws and love towards cats,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make it more illustrativeThe examples are very less and not explained properly for beginner,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And also during one of the quizzes the platform wasn't working propperly  and I had to answere it many times,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like this course to be longer,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To have more practices and to have at least one lab with data for running some simple functions Other than that I think is a good course,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gives some good information but the git section is not really well made and it could have some improvements on sound and quality,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hope that the following courses have some serious math and advance topics,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So it should integrated with other kind of specialization,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course coud have been provided as intro to R programming course or it could be just planned for 1 week,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can be bit more comprehensive by giving an overview of other tools available to do the same operations and also why this tool set has been chosen	",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You could have taken one data set and have done all shorts of things and then in the midst thrown some quizzes to student instead of going though all the discussion in one go,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no need for videos The content can simply be presented in one single PDF in a time-saving way,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a good course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a bad course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not a good course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good course nice illustrations that really support the course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good course for someone with background of statistics,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in this respect it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its carried out in excellent way,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good explainations with plenty of examples,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great teaching on the subject,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely great start for statistics with R Not too heavy in time not too light Amazingly curated course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is very beneficial to me,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It explains the theory very clearly and lively that we can easily learn the concepts,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beside  R-lab helps me about the R language This is very important,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inspiring course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love the main lecture of the statistics The Subject is fun After couple lecture  my mind was very clear,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it would be better if require R knowledge If not  student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoy the class but the extra is a bit heavy for me,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great presentation easy to understand with good examples Way to go,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course is an excellent comprehensive introduction to Stats It is challenging but in a very good way,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expectations are set sufficiently high that you need to grasp the concepts to succeed Excellent MOOC,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is very helpful,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course excellent professors  wonderful support material and presentations Great leink woth DataCamp love it ,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now working on week 5 of this course First four weeks were VERY well taught,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clear examples AND above all the datacamp R tutorials make it more than worth your while,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This course rises FAR above the many Coursera MOOC's that i took It is very complete and do-able,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is a great comprehensive course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great explanations Clear examples I love the stories and the drawings Good thought pedagogical concept,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great materials and teachers This is one of the best courses I have found,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nicely done guys,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice examples! Carry on with the good work,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very clear and awesome,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very well put together,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loved presentation style Very simple way to teach complex concept,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A difficult subject made easy and interesting,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wish there more exercise to practise home in order to master the concepts,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best course on statistics Concepts explained in very simple language and through beautiful visualizations,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect material Perfect instructors and perfect course!,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great class! Thank you for all clear explanation 	positive",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course innovative design great content and Organization Great teachers and didactic,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good lecturesbut the R-lab is horrible Do not take this class,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent positive,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only the firs week of this course but I can already tell that it is going to be incredibly useful to me,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have learned a lot and especially love the introduction to R through datacamp,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best statistics course ever,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the notes given after the lectures should contain the formula the students need	suggestions",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also the quizes should show the correct answers once you completed them if not you cant figure out why the questions are wrong,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sometimes there are misspellings - which makes it even harder to know what he's saying	negative",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the presenter's accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what he's saying,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this student was inundated with formulas that needed to be practiced and i did not even have time to write them down,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the subtitles sometimes do not accurately represent what he's saying,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have recently passed the first week and I should say that was awesome,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I found this course very helpful and understandable,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The slides are very beautiful designed I had never learnt Statistics in this way,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The examples are related to our daily life! It makes everything easier to learn	positive",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you very much all who works on this course from University of Amsterdam	positive",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clear video's & examples easy to follow,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Straightforward and intuitive Great way to get an introduction to the specialization	positive",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just wish that they would make the linux optional or part of a different course,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought that there was way too many times of 'We won't be covering it in here  check the suplemental reading,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I kind of hoped for better explanations on some topicsAll in all I guess it was a good overview for us though,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I did all of the work but could  not get the credit because I had major problems with the assignments	negative",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy these courses but this one not so much,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I realize that this is an entry level course but it seemed like most of the meat of the course was in the readings and not covered in the lectures,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lecturer was terrible!,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So far the worst experience I have had in this certificate,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This person would even bore the dead,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the whole plan of the course,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was chaotic,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jumping from easy tasks to more complicated without enough explanation being done and some points were just awful,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best thing you can do here is to just read transcript below video and read read and once again read additional materials You will hardly learn anything here,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only good thing were two last labs but they were grade with 0% weight value,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good class with a lot of info,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I would say break it in to a few smaller labs where we practice the command lines more to get better accustomed with stuff and it would be great	",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the course had very useful topics,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought the presenter was too fast sometimes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the time external material was referred to be read I thought the course could have been more indepth in material,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the labs that you are required to take as part of the quizzes for this particular course are just flat out poorly implemented,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately I have to rate this course rather low due to the nature of the labs,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cindy was very well spoken and knowledgable about the topics that were covered,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for several weeks I was unable to participate in the labs - often having to wait 24-72 hours just to get in at all,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the labs were a mess The course should be free until the labs actually work,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of the labs were very buggy They were very frustrating to work through	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the information was Ok,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Videos are good,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But labs can be very confusing and difficult to perform,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very well-taught and complete statistics course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lab experience was really frustrating	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not sure how much I actually learned in this course and the labs were INCREDIBLY buggy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think other future users would appreciate more consideration being put into the labs and testing into them prior to distribution,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think having the videos mask the true lab experience would be helpful,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This have being such a frustrating experience nothing is working correctly,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cannot get grades to update How are we to learn if the courses are broken?	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can be the worst,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So much wasted time to try and get those things to get scores correct,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give you an hour or more to do the lab but it takes like 30 mins to get the lab setup,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have to sit and wait for the VM to load all the content and sometimes they are missing content,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if you start this course look at the forums before each lab and see what others are doing to get the passing scores,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this would be an excellent course	",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how smart people like you made so many stupid mistakes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only answer is that you are ignorant and greed,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE LABS ARE HORRIBLE,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Final lab exercise is so vague and buggy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lab projects are weak,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your lab is beyond stupid,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had problems with some of the labs	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the labs were broken beyond repair and that caused me a significant amount of frustration,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the Windows tasks are far too remedial  the grading doesn't work half the time,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The labs are very buggy,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Linux stuff is pretty good,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The information is pretty basic,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Labs are broken	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The labs do not work as intended	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Labs are completely broken links are incorrect wont give completions or grades on completed assignments,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By learning this much only we can't become an expert in OSNot satisfied	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instructor talks way to fast making it difficult to understand,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I found it a little to basic	",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wish there were things work hands on during this course,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the information is good,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the labs in the courses are broken for the most part,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The whole certification should be put on hold until the labs and other problems are fixed,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Support is very slow and hard to understand - English is a second language for many of the staff,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wish there were things work hands on during this course	",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seemed unfinished in places with far too much supplemental reading of Wikipedi,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The labs  especially Windows based were difficult to connect to and use,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very friendly to people who want to start learning R and practicing it straight away,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consistent use of exercises in R were extremely useful as well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would highly recommend this course and learning system for people like me who never thought they'd be able to grasp mathematics,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great watching all this numbers telling you information about people  though my numbers were slightly different sometimes,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very dynamic and enjoyable class  great instructors and combination of theory and hands-on exercises,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well explained and clear enough to be followed even by non mathematicians,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very dynamic and enjoyable class,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great course  highly recommended,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So far a very nice course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I loved it very much Easy to understand  visual and enjoyable explanations,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clear simple but engaging,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The three lessons about R have been a fun,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am looking forward to start the next session,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is best course on statistics at least for me who is comparatively new to it I recommend it 100%,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the course very much so far,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pacing is excellent and the material is very well adjusted to learners without much previous knowledge of the field,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a high level course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good to get the intuition behind the theory,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is wonderful how teacher have broken down each and every concept,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Examples helps in clearing the concept well,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both of the lecturers as well as the staff are excellent in making the learning simple,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have learned so much about statistics in so short a time with effectiveness and efficiency,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good coursenice illustrations that really support the course,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for the excellent work,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And all of you have made University of Amsterdam proud and stand tall,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
